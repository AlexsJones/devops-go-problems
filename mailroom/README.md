# Mailroom

The international mail organisation is looking at improving their mail delivery to Australia. Each letter needs to have a postcode, street address, suburb, and state to ensure that it can be delivered.  Any post that is missing any of these will be rejected and returned back to sender. In addition, they want to gather statistics as to how many letters are sent to each state or territory at the end of the day.
